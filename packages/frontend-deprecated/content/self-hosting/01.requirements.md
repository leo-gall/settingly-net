# Requirements

Settingly has a few requirements that need to be met before installation. These requirements are necessary for the application to function properly. But don't worry, we'll guide you through the process of meeting these requirements.

## Docker

Settingly is designed to run in a Docker container. This means that you need to have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed, you can follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

## Docker Compose

Settingly uses Docker Compose to manage the application and its dependencies. You need to have Docker Compose installed on your system. If you don't have Docker Compose installed, you can follow the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for your operating system.

## Clerk

Settingly uses Clerk for authentication. You need to have a Clerk account, a properly configured Clerk application, and the API keys for your Clerk application. If you don't have a Clerk account, you can sign up for one at [Clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev/). Once you have a Clerk account, you can switch to our [Clerk setup guide](/docs/installation/clerk) to set up your Clerk application and get your API keys.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Once you have Docker, Docker Compose, and Clerk set up, you're ready to install Settingly.
